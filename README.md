# Battleship demo
Battleship computer vs computer using Go

This is very simple demo to show my current Go knowledge. That demo should be accessed via ```http://localhost``` 
at standard port #80. It shows the boards and fill with the ships. That's all at this point.

I used in this demo:
- variables, constants, types
- slices
- arrays
- packages
- structures
- pointers
- pseudo-object-methods
- imports, including remote
- loops, conditions, switches, functions
- go html templates
- conditions, loops in templates
- subtemplates
- basic web server with two commands and static content
- session handling
- json

To run the demo type ```go build battleship.go```
